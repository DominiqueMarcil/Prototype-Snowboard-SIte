            <h2>Could you imagine life without font variables...</h2>
                <p>Font variables, the new up and coming cornerstone to modern webdesign. <br>These font variables have brought about a significant transformation in how we <br> perceive and engage with web typography. Font variables have opened up a world of creative<br> possibilities, while also enhancing website readability, accessibility, performance, flexibility, and <br> responsiveness. Not to mention what a time and space saver font variables have become. <br>

                Your browser does not support the audio element.
            </audio>
            <p class="feature-p">While auto play with audio is not supported in most browsers for obvious reasons,<br> auto play is a beneficial feature that has been intorudced in the last 5 years. It enables videos <br> (that are put on mute) to begin playing upon page entry. I think thats pretty nifty. </p>

        <p>&copy; This site was made with the assistance of ChatGTP.<br> While it is a useful tool, you must know the basics of HTML and CSS<br> in order to make the AI generative code more comprehensible and user friendly. It is with that, that I believe AI <br>will be a highly beneficial tool to web developers as well as anyone else who may partake in UX/UI design. <br>Although, there are issues that arise with using AI, such as its inability to create DRY code, and its use of <br>[main] [/main] over [section] [/section]. 
            <br>
            <br>Seeing as how you need a fairly fluent understanding of how base functions work, in HTML and CSS in order for <br> your given code to actually function together and look appealing, AI is not, at least in this point in time and in my<br> opinion, a cause for concern in regards to how it can impact design/development employment opportunities.<br> When AI can make realistic looking hands, that's when we need to be worried.</p>
